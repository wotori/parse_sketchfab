Board game as seen in the 3-2-1 Penguins! episode �The Cheating Scales of Bullamanka�.
Pieces include: 6 Yellow Capped Whopper-Dingys (the green pieces), 6 Red-Naped Ibs (the yellow pieces), the Squid-Hopper, and the Toad-Roller
NOTE: I also want to clear up any possible confusion about the Toad-Roller�s mouth shape keys. The mouthpiece gets scrunched up so that when you rotate the mouth to about �Y=90��, parts of the mouth don�t clip through the head.

Damn that looks fine, also if you want to know how to use the broken effect from AR just use the clear coat and grunge textures� You want to import all Grunge Textures (Unsorted Textures) and the Character�s MRAC texture, set the top texture in Clear coat to Grunge map 08, 12, etc. Just don�t use the colored ones� The tint is unneeded. Set roughness to anything but the maps, (whipe leak, galvonic large or small) whatever works best, then at the bottom set the normal map to the MRAC and it should work

This is a posed version of the Roman Soldier model - also available in T-posed version - click this link for T-pose version https://skfb.ly/6UvOV
This model of the soldier in fighting pose has been designed for 3d printing. The download contains the textured FBX version shown here and an STL file with all of the surface detail baked into the geometry - see image below. I have not yet printed this model but I have loaded the file into Chitubox and all looks fine.
As with all of my models that are free to download you may use it in any way including commercially.
To access all of the files click the download button above and choose original format. Unzip the downloaded file - open the source folder and unzip the file in that folder (for some reason this zip file is named �old man head� but it is the right one!) - this should give you the FBX and the STL files. Contact me if you have any problems.

A fox girl, a fox girl, I made a Fox girl!
Say hello to Weiss guys! she is the main character of the fanfiction: Remnant of an Angel (RWBY/NGE Dual-SI) As always it has been fun working together with artists that can make art I am horrible at. I hope that this will inspire them to make many more chapters XD I�m really looking forward to seeing what it will become!
P.S. I am still no good at animating, plz if anybody is any good and is willing to make short animations for free (I am not paid for making this thing it is just my hobby) contact me!! I am super interested and willing to make 3D things in exchange.
P.S.S. There is a strong chance that I will update this model in the future with little things here and there.
Sincerely, Askasknot

Scan of sculpture by artist Dmitry Kravtsov. For photogrammetry, 91 photos were used (masked in Masquerade), and it took a lot of time to fix the object in the correct position, create a stand for rotation (a regular stand for decorating cakes) and create the right lighting. Aso applyed Deccimation filter to this model (lower polygon cout, to reduce the file size, for a limit of 50 MB on a free sketchfab account). Made with Canon EOS 60D and 3DF Zephyr Lite Steam Edition. 3D Scan created for the competition �3Dflow World Cup�. #3dflowcup20

https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/lara-croft-character-asset-accc60a862c24d86a26691c9b87cf546

Callum_Alcock
For my Final Major Project and last module of my current University course, I took up the challenge of trying to produce a human female character with likeness to that of a living person. I chose to attempt to recreate a version of the Lara Croft character. I based this asset on Alicia Vikander�s portrayal of the character from the Tomb Raider film (2018). The main goal was for the character model to achieve a close likeness to Alicia Vikander. However, I was aware that complications would arise and there will be difficulties portraying reality at my current level, so I was focusing on the character to feel like Lara Croft more than Alicia Vikander specific. Given that this was my first attempt at a realistic human character pipeline, I am pleased with the overall result and look forward to improving upon what I have made here. I hope that with time and practice my skills will improve so that I might one day join the industry as a competent digital artist.

I�m not very experienced with material transfer to Zbrush so some materials and colors are a little funky and there�s some clipping that doesn�t occur in Zbrush or my renders. I�ll tweak it as I learn. For nice renders, check here: https://twitter.com/lycariously/status/1294324968826605573
This is Galdrex Vul�rath, my dragonborn ranger character. Galdrex was born from the idea of �a dragonborn ranger whose favored enemy is dragons.� He was one of many trophy hunters for his clan, bringing back items to appease the black dragon that lorded over them and claimed to have �created� his clan. Then it destroyed his clan anyway.
Sculpted in Zbrush with some Blender pieces, materials are native or from the Pixologic resources. Chain mail was done with nanomesh.

DeadCerise
A grumpy boi and a less grumpy boi.
Simple shapes made difficult by a general inability to model. Also, added a bunch of subdivision modifiers to smooth out the models, the original meshes have a significantly lesser poly count. Oh and they�ve got like 20 materials and textures, cause pfff who needs optimisation? Also I just can not with the UV editing in Blender.
Been wanting to make some animations with these guys for at least 7 years now, so after finally deciding on a 2D animation software decided to make em all 3D like. Mainly used emission shaders, in order to keep the 2D feel of the sketch. I was going to look into animating the face textures, then I thought maybe I could draw facial features over a rendered movie? Not sure, both of those options feel like it�d be a lot of work.

The Gleam Eyes 74th floor Boss from the Sword Art Online series. One of my first completed 3D models with textures, rig and a set of animations (walking, running, attacking, etc. - that was my early attempt in animating, so it�s a bit clumsy) I�ve created a couple of years ago. All rights on the original design belong to their respective owners.

After a long time of sitting unfinished, here he is! This guy has been collecting dust in my computer files for a while. He started as a class project, but I never felt I did the original concept art justice after the one week I had to work on him, so I decided to resculpt and finally get around to texturing him. I had to fix a lot of stuff as well as optimize him for him to be game ready! I�m very happy with how this guy turned out, and it was a good piece to practice all aspects of the pipeline since I did a lot of back and forth changes. I decided to go a bit more realistic and dirty than in the concept by adding grime, barnacles, mold, etc. Sculpted in ZBrush, Modeled/Retopo/UVs in Maya, textured and rendered in Substance Painter with Iray

The pack is a set character- weapon m4a4 and USP tactical both Hipoly and Low poly. Please read my note carefully.
Hipoly: more than 500k tris Lowpoly: more than 80k tris ( full accessories) I made this for PC version. If you want to use for Mobile, you need to downgrade Polygon on Low version or remove unnecessary accessories. I can�t guess what every client uses for so I only create a standard version. I keep hair in Hi and Low as same. You can use them or remove as you like. Texture size is 4096. ( I made 3 versions for character) Weapon : M4a4 - USP tactical. They are being sold in my store. No rigging or Anim is available. I don�t sell rigged model because it�s not perfect for animators. PBR material.
Meshes: FBX and Obj ( I attached in Additional files) Cold_Captain_hi_helmet Cold_Captain_hi_without_helmet Cold_Captain_low_helmet Cold_Captain_low_without_helmet m4a4 USP tatical
Texture packs: ( they are attached in Sketchfab) Texture for character ( 3 versions) -M4a4 texture -USP tactical texture

This model has separate textures for different parts of the mesh in order to keep a high texture resolution without having to use one gigantic texture map. Modelled and textured with Blender.

I�m primarily a 2d artist and fairly new with making a 3d model to completion, and this is the first one I�ve liked enough to upload. There are plenty of mistakes and I�ve learned a lot of things (Like making sure to thoroughly check my UVs BEFORE I start texture painting for one). I enjoyed myself, though, and want to keep making models. Character concept is mine. Blender from start to finish with Bpainter to help with texture painting.

Her face, hand tattoos, face paint and some of her coins were influenced by God of War characters, environments, props and viking mythology. The goal was to explore a dark lovecraftian character with a viking twist and make it real-time.

The Scratcher,
while beeing a pretty harmless creature on its own, it usually is part of a bigger group. These groups are using a telepathy network to communicate and alarm each other. When dealing with a Scratcher it is safe to use silent weapons to not alarm nearby enemies as well. They go down easy and quick but if missed the shot can call up a whole swarm to rip and tear whatever is threatening them.

Inspired by masks seen in the anime �Natsume Yuujinchou�.
Created by heavily modifying two 3D models - a Code Geass Zero Mask only using the visor section and a horn on an antler model - the same as in my first uploaded version. Will link to the original models soon.
Comes in 3 parts. Face mask + 2 separate horns.
EDIT: sorry, wasn�t happy with the width of the eye spacing, so narrowed things, so the eyes sit closer.

This model was made for a university project two years ago and I finally came back to texture it after all this time. The Borderlands style is pretty fun as you can be quite messy and it still looks intentional.

This is a model I created using concept art from Gemini which is an indie game in development. I had it look like a human skull had deformed to become more like a crows head which caused the beak to tear through their face. It was fun to work with an opacity map in this project to create the feathers covering the crows head without adding too much to the poly count.

Fireman memorial statue
Kings Park, Perth, Western Australia.
31� 57� 50.046� S, 115� 50� 13.278� E
The Firefighters` Memorial Grove commemorates Western Australian firefighters who have been injured or lost their lives, as well as the service offered to the community by all firefighters.
Two life-sized bronze statues modelled on Western Australia�s firefighters were unveiled at the firefighters memorial grove on the 4th May 2014. The statues reflect the sorrow felt by firefighters losing a comrade, and are a fitting tribute to the courage and selflessness of the State�s fire service personnel.
Standing approximately 1.8 metres tall, the statues are part of an enhancement of the grove that now includes a commemorative curved stone wall and a linking pathway to other monuments.

Thanks for stopping in and meeting Harold. You can download him and do whatever to him. It�s not that I don�t care what you do to him. I ask that you be respectful to him and to everyone else for that matter.

This is a model I sculpted for the PolyCount Bi-Monthly art challenge!
The intial sculpt was created in Maya, and the high poly details were sculpted in Zbrush. Texturing for this model was done inside of Substance Painter.
Overall it was a quick little project to test my skills and turn concept art into a finalized piece! The concept art was provided by ArtStation User Aishwarya Chandramohan:

The Ice King is one of five elemental kings, judging by the five thrones in his castle, of which only two kings have been revealed. His kingdom is the Winter Kingdom. This is known as he mentions it in a Save The World voice line. His weapons of choice seem to be the Ice Scepter and the Infinity Blade.

Oro, similar to the Blackheart, is a skeleton with a visible golden skull, ribs and bones with a gold crown on his head. He also shares some similarities with Midas, some being he has a scar in the same place as Midas. In fact, most of his body is so gold that the name, Oro, literally means �Gold� in Spanish.

sigmundardottir
Plushy asset created for a university module on Photogrammetry. I used a lightbox, turntable and a Canon Camera to take 7 sets of around 36 images each of my dinosaur plush Hank. The sets of images were taken from slightly different angles and when all the images were put through Metashape Agisoft, I had a base mesh to work off. From there I patched up the mesh in Zbrush and sculpted details into the mesh. This became the high poly mesh that was used in Substance Painter to bake all the surface information and details onto a much lower poly mesh. The lower poly mesh was created in Zbrush by using the �ZRemesher - Targeted Polygons Count�.

ZBrush sculpt of one of my favorite disney villains of all time - Gaston! (Or at least the way I always imagined him looking in 3D) Now that I have some free time I decided to practice some more sculpting, and also experiment with substance painter a bit. Definitely not the best result, but practice and trying out new things never hurt! The goal here wasn�t to create a perfect game ready model, but rather get a feel for working with substance painter while also still familiarizing myself with zbrush more and just having a bit of fun.

The Ground Shadows feature allows you to automatically add a ground plane under a model without creating it yourself before uploading.
The Baked AO option bakes an ambient occlusion texture onto the ground plane. It will take about 10 seconds to prepare the baked texture each time you adjust settings. To see this model without a ground shadow (and other post-processing effects), tap the 1 button on your keyboard.

To learn more about using our Ground Shadow feature, visit the Help Center.

A quartzite Clagett projectile point recovered during the 1949 excavation of the Deep Creek site in Howard County, Maryland by Richard Stearns and the Natural History Society of Maryland. The Clagett point dates to the Late Archaic Period ranging from 3000-2000 BP (approximately 3700-2450 BC). The Clagett point is long and narrow, and is thick in cross section. It has pronounced shoulders and an expanded stem. The base is usually straight or slightly concave.

so i found out about the #foodcartchallenge a little bit late, but decided that i couldnt pass up on the opportunity to model something for the theme.
the concept and idea are my own, but the character belong to nintendo and their series creators respectively.
i tried to stay within the style of both franchises, but tweak�d em so that they wouldn�t clash too much.
the modeling was done in zbrush, retopo�d in maya, and hand painted in substance painter :>
